## Technologies Used

The website is build in a simple way on purpose. The user should not wait for many downloaded media-files or animations. Major CDNs were included (aware of the conflict with the aforementioned statement) to include up-to-date security patches of implemented JavaScript. 

The base technologies are HTML and CSS. Some JavaScript is used to achieve more efficient use of the viewport on mobiles (collapsing navigation-menu).

The hand made “cards” which are used as main design element for the different lists where chosen in preference of Bootstrap cards, as the [documentation (v4.1.x)](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/card/#card-layout) states layout options for series of cards are not yet a responsive element.

### Slack review
The project was posted to Slack the Code Institute community channel peer-code-review for different pairs of eyes.

### Readme
Readme was observed on GitHub. All links were clicked.

## Deployment
The relevant files for deployment of the project are

The easiest way (but not the tiniest in terms of filesize - the download includes the development gitpod files) is to click on "Code" on the top of this page (top right above the file list) and on "Download zip".  
Afterwards extract the zip (most OS include a packaging program for it, just right click on it) into the required folder (read below).

### Local
For local use, download the files and the folder, put them (or extract) into the same directory and open the **index.html** file with your browser.

### Deployed / Hosted
For deployed use, download the files and the folder, put/upload/extract them into the folder advised by your hoster (e.g. "www", but it depends - check back with your hoster / the documentation!).  
Be cautious not to alter the file hierarchy.

### with GitHub pages
If you are logged into your GitHub Account (if not: Sign up - its free!) just click on "Fork" on the top right of this page.
Afterwards in the "Settings" (top menu, right beyond the name of the repository) menu, go to "Options" (top menu item), and afterwards scroll down to "GitHub Pages", select "Master branch" as source and click "Save".
To get to the deployed site afterwards, click on the link.
