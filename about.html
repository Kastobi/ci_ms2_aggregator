    <h2>About the project</h2>
    <h3>“What to learn after JavaScript – React, Angular or Vue?”</h3>
    <p>
        Analogous questions are asked over and over by frontend development students. There are many approaches to
        answer
        this question – but in general the popularity of the libraries should be considered. Information on the subject
        in
        aggregated form is rare, subjective opinions are widely spread and often controversial.
    </p>

    <h3>What is used by the websites</h3>
    <p>
        One approach is to observe the “websites out there” – with the problem of unmaintained, abandoned homepages,
        libraries just included as dependencies of other libraries etc. Even if this approach teaches you, which
        technologies were used in the past to build websites, you are still lacking the “state of the art” information.

    </ul>

    <h3>Observe GitHub explore channles (topics, trending, ...)</h3>
    <p>
        Another approach is to observe GitHubs information channels (on trending repositories or topics, or the
        specific repositories in comparison) to evaluate the popularity among developers. This approach lacks filtering
        and
        comparison features – time is needed for an in-depth research about every topic – and the chance for missing
        some important library depends on circumstances.
    </p>

        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Observe workflow tools: Google Trends</h3>
    <p>
        A different approach focuses on the workflow of developers – use a general tool to observe their work. Google
        trends let you compare timelines of search terms/queries – making it possible to compare terms like “jQuery”,
        “React”, “Angular” and “Vue” – even to focus on your potential market for future employers.
        The problem with this approach – everyone uses Google and not every term is unique (there is a “Nike React” foam
        material for running shoes out there).
        The classification of the terms on the public interface does not allow concise filtering (Computer & Electronics
        → Programming, Open Source? Internet & Telecom → Web Design & Development? Jobs & Education → Computer
        Education?)…
    </p>

    <h4>References</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            I recommend playing a little with terms and categories to evaluate the worth of your specific query for
            yourself.

        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Aggregate information for fast overviews</h3>
    <p>
        To help learning developers, I try to aggregate some information in this project (Data from cdnjs API, the
        GitHub information included and Google trends). Further research is needed, but a basic level of information on
        market shares and popularity of different libraries is available and from this level of information, the learner
        is able to delve deeper into the sources I built upon.
    </p>


    <h4>Problems to keep in mind, while using my data</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>cdnjs’ GitHub Data may not always be up to date.</li>
        <li>Even if cdnjs is a big player, I do not have any information if their supply is representative and
            comprehensive
            for the market. As my index is purely based on their API, there may be big gaps I am not aware of.
        </li>
        <li>I am not able to clean or revise the base data (cdnjs API, Google Trends) with my approach.</li>
    </ul>
